```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Additional pages and assets added:

- `team.html` — simple team listing with placeholder SVG headshots
- `assets/img/favicon.svg` — site favicon
- `assets/img/team1.svg`, `team2.svg`, `team3.svg` — placeholder images used on the team page

These are lightweight SVG placeholders so the site is still fully static and fast.
